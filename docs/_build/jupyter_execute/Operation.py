# An operation may also be called a function or a computation.

# Let $A$ be a nonempty set.<br>
# For example, a __unary operation__ on $A$ is a function from $A$ to $A$.<br>
# A __binary operation__ on $A$ is a function from $A \times A$ to $A$.<br>
# A __ternary operation__ on $A$ is a function from $A \times A \times A$ to $A$.<br>
# In general, an __$n$-ary operation__ on $A$ is a function from $\underbrace{A \times A \times ... \times A}_{n \,\text{times}}$ to $A$.<br>

# <span style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;">**Structure**</span>

# A structure is a nonempty set $A$ with a collection of one or more operations on $A$ and a possibly empty collection of relations on $A$.<br>
# A structure may also be called an algebraic structure or an algebraic system.<br>

# Examples of structures:
# 
# $(\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot, \lt)$
